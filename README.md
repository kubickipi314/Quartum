# ðŸ”®Quartum
## Project
This is the project of a simple web game to learn JS and styling.
[you can plan here](https://kubickipi314.github.io/Quartum/).
## Rules
It is a simple tic-tac-toe based game. One place a sign on one of four
boards, to decide where it's adversary is teleported. The winner is
one who connects four signs in a line or square.

## Idea
The idea is taken from 9x9 tic-tac-toe version with similar rule-set
althoug more complex and long to play;

## Name
Quartum is the fusion of Quart and Quantum, as everything is four-based
and fractioning and teleporation reminds quantum mechanicsðŸ”®.
