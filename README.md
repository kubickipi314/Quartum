# ðŸ”®Quartum

### Project
This is the project of minimalistic web game written
in JavaScript and CSS. You can play it [here](https://kubickipi314.github.io/Quartum/).

### Rules
It is a simple tic-tac-toe based game. Players place their signs
on one of four little 2x2 boards, to decide where their adversary
is teleported (taken field points to one of the four boards). 
The winner is one who connects four signs in a line or fill
entire small board.

### Motives
Players can change motives of their signs clicking
the icons in the score section.

### Idea
The idea is inspired by 9x9 tic-tac-toe version with
similar rule-set although more complex and long to play.

### Name
Quartum is the fusion of words Quart and Quantum, as everything
is four-based and fractioning together with teleporation
reminds quantum mechanicsðŸ”®.
